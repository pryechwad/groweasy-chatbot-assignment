🚀 What this project does
✅ Receive & handle leads automatically
As soon as a new lead comes in, the chatbot starts a conversation just like a human sales assistant.

✅ Qualify leads smartly
Through a friendly question-answer flow, it figures out whether the lead is:

Hot (highly interested, needs immediate follow-up)

Cold (not ready yet, nurture later)

Invalid (spam or wrong info)

✅ Store & manage leads efficiently
All chat transcripts, qualification results, and important lead details (budget, location, timeline, etc.) are captured — so your sales team never misses a beat.

✅ Fully configurable
We’ve designed the system so you can update:

Which industry it represents

Which questions it asks

How it classifies leads

Start with real estate, expand to anything!
